## Description
My personal portfolio is a reflection of my identity as a software developer, highlighting my background, experience, and the coding creations I have developed. Focused on the use of React.js technologies, my project showcases essential characteristics in every endeavor: visual elegance, specialized functionalities to enhance the user experience, responsive design, and a concise presentation of relevant information. It also demonstrates my proficiency in Front-end technologies such as React.js, CSS with the Sass preprocessor, and the implementation of clean code. Additionally, for image storage and the curriculum vitae, I have utilized AWS as a reliable platform.
