I entered the tech world through the industrial sector, learning algorithms, C++, and PLC as I pursued my education. Since then, my focus has revolved around coding. As a junior full stack developer, I merge creativity with technical skills to approach projects from diverse perspectives, aiming to create functional solutions and meaningful user experiences.
